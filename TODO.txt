thread and performance optimizations (program seems to use ~25% of my cpu, when it first starts up with nothing running)
ability to change the pixel size without the need to clear the screen (possibly by implementing a hashmap)
allow user to change UI background colour, and colours for the ant and its surroundings
save user preferences (either through serialization of parts or all of the UI, or through the Preferences class which is something I would like to look at)
add option to save and load custom rules
better timing/speed control - lower speeds need to go slower, higher speeds need to go faster, and if possible, a transition into unlimited speed



*******************************************BUGS*******************************************
000001: the more ants you add, the faster the animation seems to go - try W1N1N1E1, and add multiple ants
FIXED 000002: possible bug with ants not correctly looping from the edge of the world (use custom rule R2L, and compare animation with and without edge looping; may just be intended)
000003: setting pixel size to 1 causes extreme lag - i think it cant keep up with the rendering; it works fine at 2px, but at 1px it has to draw 4 times as much stuff
FIXED 000004: very long custom rule will stretch out the gui indefinitely
